Max has grown as a driver during the years, you are making mistakes and maybe its time for the next generation. You dont want to be remembered as the one causing a collission and injuring (or worse) someone. You are better than that. If its Max his time, then so be it. I am really happy Max is ok!

      "Please let us all uphold  the Truth as we all saw it during and after the race review. Max Verstappen blocked Lewis several times from the start of the race and when he tried to block him again he miscalculated causing a collision and bounced off Lewis's vehicle. Lewis had no intention of colliding into him. Max was in hospital for a check up following an accident like all race drivers are checked after a serious accident but it is unnecessary to exaggerate the potential injury just so Lewis can look bad. And for the people giving out hate speech to him......I don't think he cares whether you have lost respect for him or not so keep your comments to yourself. How can you accuse him of not caring whether max Verstappen is in \"hospital\" when he inquired over Verstappen's well being during the race and after. The only reason they wants Lewis disqualified is because they realized he won even after being given the 10 second penalty which reduced the gap so they want him to have 0 points so that Max is at the top again. All racists just insecure because a black man is making it so you try to ruin his name. Shame on all the people making racist comments and hate speech.\n",

      "I think you have come out of this behaving like a true champion Lewis. You showed a lot dignity. Many would have got drawn into a spat over the incident and reacted to Max’s emotional comments from the hospital. You didn’t. In doing so they are the ones that now look “disrespectful and unsporting”. They should have accepted the view of the stewards (and all other independent observers) that it was a racing incident. Christian Horner is a true professional, but he looked petty and juvenile when he said your victory was hollow. If Max was a real champion (and I’m a fan of his!) then he would have congratulated you and come out fighting for the rest of the season. I suspect this incident will define the season. The momentum is now with you and he doesn’t behave like a champion. So sadly he may never be one. In the midst of his emotional rant, Christian Horner referred to you mistakenly as “an eight time world champion” - maybe that clip will get replayed at the end of the season when you are!! Good luck and thank you for behaving like Federer, Woods and all other sporting legends.\n",

Senna said in that interview “If you no longer go for a gap which exists you are no longer a racing driver” and I totally agree with that statement. This is racing. Can’t disagree with Ayrton Senna. I mean all I see is people complaining but have those people ever thought about the philosophy behind lewis’s statement? Pretty sure his intention wasn’t to hit max, he just went for a gap that existed, which maxes him a pretty good racing driver. Those are the risks you take with you as racing driver.\n",

I couldn’t care less abt the color of his skin or his beliefs, but what he did in that race just wasn’t ok in any way and he totally deserves the negative comments he’s receiving.

Of course he knew better not to force himself so close to max but in the heat of the moment he tried hard and f**ked it up but it was obviously Not On Purpose!!!

It is a sad thing to see that despite we are in the XXI century we still have people that look at others over the shoulder believing that they are superior to others because of whatever cross their empty heads... You have great sportsmanship and have shown the great human being you are over the years.  All of those people who went over you are just jealous and envy that you once again showed to the world that is not the car, but the driver who wins races, you keep demonstrating why you are the G.O.A.T of F1 !

It was a racing accident but comparing youre move with the same move you made with charles leclerc? With charles you were more on the inside of the corner hitting the apex. With max you did not. Stewards punished you for that and rightfully so in my opinion. Celebrating in front of 100.000+ fans is normal and deserved but.. most max fans had respected you more for accepting the stewards outcome and said sorry, hope max will be ok and move on!!.. think you had gained more respect then. Just my opinion.. again.. hope you and max will keep in fighting in this exciting year. Hope ferrari and mclaren can fight you and max next year too.. that would be great!!!\n",

He did not want to always give up the position like he does in all tracks. 👏🔥🔥❤️. And how many times did drivers make collisions and they were not suspended. So why are you trying to suspend him?.

He didn't and attempted to close the window but was too late and suffered the consequences. Its what racing is all about and all the drivers take that risk when getting into the car. Roll on your next race. I hope Max is okay and im sure he will learn and not be so eager to close a gap when  hes on the outside of a corner.\n",

Also to say VER being hospitalized is a routine is BS as well, because 51G at a body weigjt of 75kg is a weight of 3.8 tons your body is subject to.

      "So much hatred on here, it’s heartbreaking…. One of the first things Lewis asked  immediately after the incident was ‘is Max ok?’….not sure if any of you heard that.  It’s incredibly sad that there’s so much anger and hatred on here.  I’ve no doubt that if the outcome was the worst possible outcome for Max, Lewis would have been the most apologetic, devastated and humblest human alive. We need to be thankful that Max is ok and stop the Lewis hating. Of course we enjoy being passionate about the sport we follow and that’s healthy, but hating is not healthy, to the ones being hated but especially to those that do the hating. Try and find some calm and peace in yourself and look forward to the next race.\n",

It cant be \"everyone loves to see max race elbows out\" and \"let them race\" but only when he is applying the pressure.\n",

I am in love with the extraordinary driving technique of Verstappen but that should not discredit other drivers and especially not one of the greatest drivers the sport has ever seen. Both Hamilton and Verstappen have comitted controversial action's but the fanbase hate\n",

Daarmee heb je wel onprofessioneel en onverantwoord rijgedrag laten zien.  Daarmee heb je het leven van je grootste concurrent in gevaar gebracht en daarmee heb je op oneigenlijke wijze gewonnen en daarmee heb je op een discutabele wijze het puntenverschil met Max tot een minimum gereduceerd.  Oprechte excuses direct na de race en een wat minder uitbundige viering van je overwinning zou op zijn plaats zijn geweest.  Daarmee zou je je een waar sportman tonen.  Dat alles is helaas niet gebeurd.  Gemiste kans en daarmee laat je wat mij betreft je ware aard zien.  En die is dan helaas niet fraai in mijn ogen.\n",

You had better car anyway, that was your race and you have every right to rejoice that victory with your team and country.

I once had respect for you man. I'm actually shocked that you being or portraying yourself as being a man that is God fearing and that cares so much about humanity and earth can behave this way. I hope and pray that you will sort things out with Max and reflect a moment on how the events unfolded so you can grow as a person. On that day you weren't the better person nor the better driver. Max's defense was actually admirable and textbook, maybe you can learn a few things from him instead of using his past aggressive style as an excuse for the crash. Your desperation brought the worst out of you and you knew that no matter what you had a much lower risk taking that turn at that speed. Anyway sleep tight\n",

Narcissists will not only victimize themselves by crying self pity EVERYTIME they do something wrong but they will never under ANY circumstances admit they are wrong…like ever. They also have a God complex and think that they can’t do anything wrong. Hamilton can admit when he’s wrong and can apologize for that. Just because he doesn’t feel like he needs to apologize does not make him a narcissist\n",

And at your home circuit, home fans, I get all that. Maybe you thought like Senna did: \"if you no longer go for a gap that exists, you're no longer a racing driver\" but as a professional like you are,  you have to ask yourself; was there really an existing gap? Maybe, these thing can happen in the heat of the moment, but in that case you have to take responsibility and apologize, and certainly don't celebrate while your fellow racing driver is still at the hospital.\n",

When Ayerton intentionally took out Prost it was at a much slower corner where it was highly unlikely Prost could have died, but seems like Max got lucky on this one at the speeds they were going.

It was an unfortunate moment of the race, but nothing intentional or nothing that any of the two drivers did wrong in my opinion. That was an unlucky moment.” 🤷‍♂️\n",

That’s the final decision, nothing to change about that. Then your team mate let you pass (AGAIN) because of some stupid team orders. And then you got the win because the leader made a mistake and oversteered off the track. This is one of your worst victories. But you celebrated it like it was your best. Of course it’s nice to win in front of your home crowd, but it’s the 8th time doing that in F1.. Knowing what happened today and how you received your win, you should’ve celebrated and acted differently. Like Max said, it’s unsportsmanlike.\n",

Y la falta de respeto que mostró todo el equipo de mercedes al festejar de esa manera sabiendo que Max seguía en el hospital , la verdad creo que ha sido y fue una gran falta de respeto .

Lewis has backed out to his detriment over the last couple of seasons as he didn’t need to race hard to win. This year is different. Lewis needs to race just as hard as Max and give no quarter. Ask any real racing driver or refer to the regulations issued to the teams and they’ll tell you Lewis was entitled to defend his corner. Max turned in, expecting Lewis to back out and he came unstuck today. He’s fine and will be back in Hungary like the professional he is but with a little more respect for his rivals commitment and perhaps a little more hard earned experience.\n",

Cockpit views prove Max turned hard into your racing line and drove over the nose of your car. End of debate. I hope Max makes a speedy recovery. F1 can be a very dangerous sport when even the slightest of errors are made. Good luck LH44 over the rest of the season, you still rise. You are the greatest! ✨👊✨\n",

But even fair sportsmen make mistakes, like on Sunday in Copes when you tried a move that couldn't work: after touching Max's rear wheel with your front wheel, you needed the full width of the road to the curbs to stay on the track - so there would have been no room for Max anyway - but it was his corner, not yours! You made a mistake that could have cost Max his life, and the least you can do is admit that mistake and apologize to him.

Unfortunate that max had such hard impact collision..it might be a cliche but it’s racing At the very front where nobody will give an inch. I have seen a lot worst over recent years. Leclerc In italy against Hamilton was a lot more deliberate and aggressive than this which was purely a nasty racing incident.

      "Not to take anything away from you as a driver Lewis but it isn't hard to win these days is it?? When only one other car (team) can even compete with Mercedes and you took that car out at the beginning of the race. Ok, he took you out, you took him out - it was a racing incident - you both were at fault!! And even with your 10 second penalty you still came back and drove past everyone like they were standing still. Why is that Lewis? Oh ya....the other cars (teams) can't match the money and power and development of Mercedes so they don't get to compete,except with eachother. I mean it's pretty sad when even the on-air commentators refer to the other teams as \"the best of the rest\" VERY SAD!!. IS F1 even really racing anymore or  just Follow the Leaders?!?!? How do you think you'd be doing if you were on one of the other teams, driving an inferior car? You'd be lucky to have any points just like they are - let alone be a world champion over and over again.  I long for the days of REAL racing again - when every team, every car is on equal footing and can all compete with eachother! Sadly I don't think I will ever see those days again.😢 Anyhow I know you will never read this or respond - neither will Mercedes or the F1 bosses. You're all making your millions and don't really care about putting on real races for real race fans anymore. I guess it is what it is.  Be well Max!!!\n",

I know you won’t, but don’t forget you have thousands of supporters who send positive vibes to you, who understand racing and how it is… It’s dangerous yes and sadly we have lost many to the sport but those who race are there to win! You keep fighting as you know how to and we will keep supporting you through good or bad times. Keep rising, keep fighting ❤️🇬🇧🏁\n",

I didn’t have the joy of watching it at silverstone I wished I had though but I was watching it and the way you raced was unbelievable. It looked like both of you could have been in different places on the track but the fact that max verspappen moved his wheel towards your vehicle at the point of impact shows he wasn’t backing out when you were alongside him. If there was any harsher penalty then it should have gone both ways both yourself and max which would be unfair in the racing incident which it was\n",

Bike or car there is enough room to pass on that corner and a HUGE run off area to get you out of trouble..... I've used it many times myself when my talent ran out 😂. Have you seen the onboard footage?..... you can see max turn into Lewis as clear as day while Lewis holds his line. But on the other hand Lewis could have been closer to the apex 🤷‍♂️ At the end of the day, I think they're both as bad as each other.... not saying it was deliberate but Max isn't known for playing fair is he? Both max and Lewis refused to yield and the result was awful!\n",

Do you think the the way this 'feat' is being touted on social media is in good faith and in a sporting manner, regardless of who was right or wrong in the the incident? Thank you.\n",

You are a horriblwe person and lyer. You got 25 points bonus but you should be disqualified and still will be, but don´t deviate the attention becauase of the racisme, that is patetic.

I know this is racing but a person’s life is worth more than any trophy/treasures in the world. If the safety measure technology weren’t there, I think we would have a very different outcome, let this be a lesson. @fia.official needs to update it’s safety barriers(tire wall) in all the tracks, those tires weren’t enough.

Apologise when you miss a penalty when it’s part of the game and apologise when you score so you don’t hurt your opponents feelings, it could have easily been Lewis in the barriers then he would get a 5 grid penalty in Hungary for not getting out of Max’s way , and he would still have to apologise for not avoiding the Barriers Had you finished 2nd Lewis you would have had to apologise for failing to give us the excitement we craved for the last months and of cause for failing to overtake a Ferrari.

You  are my hero in the Grand Prix which I have enjoyed watching for many years! Your penalty was unfair but your passion to wing was truly inspiring!

Any small contact at that speed is not going to end well. Granted, it’s a snap decision and it’s rather unfair to assume Lewis did the move maliciously, but the way Lewis acted after the race made it seem like he just didn’t care.

All other F1 titles he won because he had the superior car and often a weaker team mate except for 2016. Now there are driver younger then him and equally or even more talented then Lewis in his younger days who put the pressure on him. These are not his team mate so no team orders can be given. So the only way left to win a race or even the championship is to sideline your competition. Being the sports man he pretends to be and bragging about fair play and how important other peoples lives are he seems, mildly said, to be playing an unfair game. He is losing his status as the best F1 ‘driver’ and as it shows he can’t handle it judging the things he says in contrast to the official authorities. The Lewis we are seeing now is the real Lewis placing himself in the center of the universe and not caring about other drivers, not even his team mate. Al the years he was winning he just put up a show to gain credit with his fans.\n",

I am disgusted with the comments made by Redbull F1 Team from the very Top down to Max suggesting you shouldn't of celebrating your win. At the time nobody new Max had been sent to our Local Fantastic NHS Hospital. Yes l believe it was a racing incident it takes two to cause a racing incident but Redbull put the blame on you. Please take no notice and keep pushing, and if you need to press Max it's great to see. Thank you for your fantastic tribute to the team. You can win this Lewis 👏👏👏🇬🇧🏆👍\n",

If he'd had won solely on his own, then hey....congrats. But Bottas has gotten robbed so many times this year and the world praises Lewis. The scale is very scewed. I'm not denying Lewis is a great driver. But this win is not one I would have gloated around about. Also, having all the English fans cheer when Max hit the wall is disgusting.

Que no sientes para nada tu error con Max, y que el desearle que este bien es de dientes para afuera.  Y en la radio ese comentario sobre las reunión que  tuvieron en la mañana me huele a que ese era el plan,  dejar fuera de la carrera a verstappen.

F1 suspension pieces are so fragile if loads are put on them in an unforecasted (not planned for) direction. I don’t see how Lewis would want to risk hitting anyone at Copse.. the results could be catastophic for both. I don’t have access to the data (and/or have not seen it yet), but I doubt Lewis turned in to him. I did not see any evidence of him turning the wheel.

If you ask people why they dislike him over other British drivers then ask for their favourite you often find out that their hero has done the exact same things... ie. Moving to Monaco, winning championships in the best car, team orders, getting paid way more than the average person buying, buying expensive things... the only thing they leave on the table after all that is the fact the guy is black... to be technical about it he's mixed race, having a white mother... but in some peoples eyes thats even worse. These people are your friends, family members, not just keyboard warriors... just deep-seated, archaic views that don't belong in our society. The man will go down in history as one of, if not the best to ever do it and some people just can't deal with that because of the colour of his skin... pathetic.\n",

I would hope max will give a little more room in future as they were about level just prior to corner he cannot expect Lewis to back off and I dont think max would have , just before the collision u can clearly see max is heading for the apex so clearly was trying to cut him off or more likely didn't expect Lewis to be there so who is at fault?  I suppose Lewis had a small amount of room that he could have taken and then if a collision did happen if Lewis was on the apex(like he was overtaking Charles) maybe no action would have been taken however because he was behind max he could have backed off to avoid max which is why i reckon he was penalised, but we want to see this kind of racing and a harsh punishment would stop it! But wow what an awesome come back it was, I was on the edge of my seat!

You saw it rise to the top when the penalties were lost in the football game and now even in victory,  they still come out with their negative canine spirit pouring scorn on talent. You cant please a diseased and mentally sick mind. But its amusing to see the sickness of thought and the level of degradation of their minds....btw that accidental was 100% verstappens fault and under a fairer system this will be the outcome. It was verstappen that turned into Lewis's path as they went round the bend, the track was wide enough and Lewis was on the outer edge and he still came too close. Moments earlier,  Lewis was ahead and on the outer bend. Verstappen has been driving like an erratic rodent from the green light and this is his general driving style and why he has many crashes under his belt, most of which like this one is self inflicted. Now Christian Horner shows his true self and starts lieing to protect bull in a China shop driving of verstappen and try to paint lewis in a bad light. There needs to be a few motorsport companies not just one.\n",

But drivers who continuously drive aggressively and doesnt back down what donyou expect. Let alone turn into another driver. Its either just fanboys or people who are new to the sport coz its stupid to just blame Lewis. If Lewis had turned out towards Max i would have said he shoild apologise and so on but he didn't.

So stop crying like babies and deal with the fact that a racing incident occurred. Everyones glad that max is okay and this will make the championship fight interesting.

I would like to be an F1 driver to understand what it feels like to drive at Cox at almost 300 km / h ... but unfortunately I am not and I cannot tell you ... the only thing I know is that I have been playing F1 since I had F1 1996 and I was racing with Williams' No. 1 driver 😂. I have since realized that if the Cox do it outside with another car nearby 98% of the time I have to restart the race... but in reality there is no restart button ... and if I see the telemetry only Lewis has braked ...

Cmon man stop the BS, your plan worked, but stop hiding the truth of your intentions. You have great race craft no doubt it. Like your politics, the public see through the BS, pity Mercedes and the GP fraternity don’t, but never-the-less you are one of the greats of your era.

He reminds me of Allan Prost…Lewis would never say, but I think deep down he is ashamed of himself. “He turned in on me.” -Lewis …You didn’t believe it when you said it.

Knowing when and where to be aggressive so that you always come out on top is true skill and Lewis just spanked Max and gave him a hard lesson. That was Man vs. Boy. Master vs. Student. \"Y'all gon learn today!\" PERFECT WIN. PLUS it was Maxs FAULT. On the replay you can CLEARLY see he turns IN to Lewis. He got what he deserved. 8th title is nkw in the bag.

You took the inside line and he turned into you rather than back off. A move that makes him look entitled and like he believes the title is his already. A rash one on his part. Personally I thought he had the edge on you this year, but if he lets his emotions get the better of him again and loses his composure he has opened the door for no 8.
